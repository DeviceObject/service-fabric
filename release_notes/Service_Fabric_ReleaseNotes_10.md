## Service Fabric Feature and Bug Fixes
| Versions | IssueType | Description | Resolution | 
|-|-|-|-|
| **Windows - 10.0.1779.959<br>Ubuntu 18 - 10.0.1694.1<br>Ubuntu 20 - 10.0.1694.1** | **Feature** | Fabric Client | **Brief Description**:  The fix in the FabricClient constructor addresses a scenario where the provided parameter "hostEndpoints" is empty or null. When the constructor is used in this way, it is assumed that the code is running inside the cluster, and the FabricClient instance will connect to the cluster via the local Gateway service on the same machine using the provided security credentials. Previously, the FabricClient instance would use default admin client security credentials, not the provided ones.<br>**Feature**: With this fix, customers can now create a FabricClient instance in their applications that can connect to the local cluster with custom security credentials. The Service Fabric SDK will internally determine the local Gateway endpoint, similar to the behavior of the parameter-less FabricClient constructor. This enhancement provides more flexibility and control for connecting to the local cluster with specific security settings.<br>**Solution**: The solution addresses an issue where the provided parameter "hostEndpoints" is empty or null. The old logic used default admin client security credentials regardless of the credentials provided in the FabricClient constructor. The fix ensures that the provided credentials are now honored, resolving the previous limitation. <br> **Documentation Reference**: Read more about it at - <ul><li>[FabricClient Constructor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.fabric.fabricclient.-ctor?view=azure-dotnet#system-fabric-fabricclient-ctor%28system-fabric-securitycredentials-system-string%28%29%29)</li></ul>**Workaround**: Cases where the "hostEndpoints" parameter is not empty or null, the security credentials provided in the FabricClient constructor are correctly honored. However, please note that this is not a complete workaround as it was impossible to instantiate a FabricClient with custom credentials and automatically determine the local Gateway endpoint using the SDK.
|**Windows - 10.0.1779.959<br>Ubuntu 18 - 10.0.1694.1<br>Ubuntu 20 - 10.0.1694.1** | **Feature** | Diagnostics | **Brief Description**: Additional information is surfaced during upgrades, enabling customers to access details about the current health check phase, the duration spent in the phase, and the number of health check flips leading to a retry. This enhancement offers improved clarity during the upgrade domain health check process.<br>**Feature**: Customers will benefit from the increased transparency in upgrade processes due to the availability of more comprehensive health check data.<br> **Solution**: The upgrade mechanism has been modified to expose critical health check phase information.<br> **Documentation Reference**: <br>
|**Windows - 10.0.1779.959<br>Ubuntu 18 - 10.0.1694.1<br>Ubuntu 20 - 10.0.1694.1** | **Feature** | KVS | **Brief Description**: When building new idle replicas in KVS, the database file is either physically copied or logically copied to the secondary replica. However, with an upcoming upgrade of the ESE dll to a new version, there might be instances where the secondary replica's ESE format version is incompatible with the primary replica, leading to potential issues during cluster upgrade/downgrade. To address this, a new feature is introduced to detect the ESE format version and send it as part of the Copy Context message during the initial handshake of the build replica process.<br>**Feature**: This feature prevents potential incompatibility issues during future SF runtime upgrades/downgrades, ensuring a smoother and error-free experience for customers.<br> **Solution**: The ESE format version field has been added to the Copy Context message sent from the secondary to the primary during the handshake. The secondary passes this information in the copy context, and if the field is not present, a default version of 0 is assumed for the secondary format, ensuring compatibility with existing releases. 
|**Windows - 10.0.1779.959<br>Ubuntu 18 - 10.0.1694.1<br>Ubuntu 20 - 10.0.1694.1** | **Feature** | ESE | **Brief Description**:  The legacy auto-compaction settings, CompactionThresholdInMB, FreePageSizeThresholdInMB, and CompactionProbabilityInPercent, have been removed and can no longer be used for determining auto-compaction at open. Instead, a new setting, FreePageSizeThresholdInPercent, introduced in versions 9.1CU3 and 9.0CU9, is now used for determining auto-compaction at open.<br>**Feature**: Auto-compaction will now be based on the FreePageSizeThresholdInPercent setting, and any existing configurations using the legacy auto-compaction settings will be disregarded. <br>**Solution/Fix**: Auto-compaction at open is now determined by the FreePageSizeThresholdInPercent setting. <br> **Breaking Change**:  Existing overrides of the legacy auto-compaction settings will be ignored. <br> **WorkAround**: To adjust the frequency and conditions for auto-compaction, please use the FreePageSizeThresholdInPercent setting. **Documentation Reference**: N/A<br>
|**Windows - 10.0.1779.959<br>Ubuntu 18 - 10.0.1694.1<br>Ubuntu 20 - 10.0.1694.1** | **Feature** | ESE | **Brief Description**: The legacy defragmentation setting, DefragThresholdInMB, can no longer be utilized to determine defragmentation occurrences. Instead, regular defragmentation will now take place, and its frequency can be adjusted using the MaxDefragFrequencyInMinutes setting.<br>**Feature**: Regular defragmentation will be triggered regardless of the database size, resulting in more accurate calculations for the physical and logical size of the database, which is used to determine auto-compaction. <br> **Solution**: Defragmentation no longer relies on the DefragThresholdInMB setting for database size comparison.<br> **Breaking Change**: Any existing overrides of the DefragThresholdInMB setting will be disregarded. <br> **WorkAround**: To adjust the frequency of defragmentation, please utilize the MaxDefragFrequencyInMinutes setting. <br>**Documentation Reference**:  For reference check here: [MaxDefragFrequencyInMinutes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.fabric.localesestoresettings.maxdefragfrequencyinminutes?view=azure-dotnet)<br> 
|**Windows - 10.0.1779.959<br>Ubuntu 18 - 10.0.1694.1<br>Ubuntu 20 - 10.0.1694.1** | **Feature** | ESE | **Brief Description**: The deprecated settings, IntrinsicValueThresholdInBytes and DatabasePageSizeInKB, have been removed from the runtime codebase. Additionally, VerPageSizeInKB is no longer utilized, as ESE now sets its own value based on DatabasePageSize.<br>**Feature**: This prevents customers from configuring these settings to suboptimal values, reducing incidents related to SF runtime caused by such configurations. <br> **Solution**: IntrinsicValueThresholdInBytes, DatabasePageSizeInKB, and VerPageSizeInKB are no longer configurable by users.<br> **Breaking Change**: Any existing overrides of the IntrinsicValueThresholdInBytes and DatabasePageSizeInKB settings will be disregarded.<br>
|**Windows - 10.0.1779.959<br>Ubuntu 18 - 10.0.1694.1<br>Ubuntu 20 - 10.0.1694.1** | **Feature** | Lease | **Brief Description**: When a node experiences resource shortages, such as insufficient memory or ephemeral ports, it reports system failures related to memory allocation, file operations, establishing connections, and communication between nodes. The triggered reports help reduce diagnosis time during such incidents and contribute to the auto-mitigation of gray nodes.<br>**Feature**: When a node is short of resources (such as ephemeral ports to establish new connections, or not enough memory to perform operations) these reports will be triggered. This will allow us to reduce the diagnosis time. This is one step towards auto-mitigation of gray node <br> **Solution**: A set of probes that periodically check for the availability of resources in the node. Every 10 seconds, the node will try to allocate 1 MB of memory, open, write, and close a file, ping its listening port (Federation), and ping the listening ports from its neighbor nodes (Federation and lease). if one of these checks were to fail more than 2 times consecutively or once per minute in a period of 5 minutes, the node will report health warnings (except in the probes that have to go through the network (not loopback), these require 15 minutes of solid failure to trigger the warning).<br> **Documentation Reference**: <br>
|**Windows - 10.0.1779.959<br>Ubuntu 18 - 10.0.1694.1<br>Ubuntu 20 - 10.0.1694.1** | **Feature** | Containers | **Brief Description**: Container image deletion is a process that facilitates image cleanup, regardless of how the images are defined - whether hard-coded in the service manifest or parameterized during application deployment. To enable image pruning, use the ContainerImageDeletionEnabled setting in the Hosting configuration. Although the older PruneContainerImages setting will still be supported, it cannot be used simultaneously with ContainerImageDeletionEnabled. For more details on these configurations and other supporting settings, refer to the public configurations.csv file. **Documentation Reference**: For more details check here:<br> [Container Image Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/container-image-management#container-image-management-v2)
|**Windows - 10.0.1779.959<br>Ubuntu 18 - 10.0.1694.1<br>Ubuntu 20 - 10.0.1694.1** | **Feature** | Failover Manager | **Brief Description**: Safety checks are corrected when minimumInstanceCount is equal to targetInstanceCount and/or minimumInstancePercentage is set to 100%.<br> **Solution**: When minimumInstanceCount set to be equal to targetInstanceCount (or minimumInstancePercentage set to 100&), Service Fabric will now create an additional instance before taking down the existing one. This ensures Service Fabric honors the safety definition (minimumInstanceCount and/or minimumInstancePercentage) provided in the Service Description. This will minimize the disruption during planned events like upgrades/repairs <br> **Breaking Change**: If a partition is configured with 5 instances and minimumInstanceCount set to 5, then SF during the upgrades/repairs will maintain a minimum of 5 instances in order to provide availability. Today without this feature, SF will bring the instance count to 4 (not honor the minimumInstanceCount value).<br> **Workaround**: User would need to account for an additional instance in their partition to account for this gap. For example when a partition is configured with 5 instances and a minimumInstanceCount of 5 needs to be maintained, they would need to update the service to bump the instance count to 6 during upgrades/repairs.<br>**Documentation Reference**: For more details check here:<br> [MinInstancePercentage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.fabric.description.statelessservicedescription.mininstancepercentage?view=azure-dotnet&viewFallbackFrom=azure-dotnet%20and%20https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fdotnet%2Fapi%2Fsystem.fabric.description.statelessservicedescription.mininstancecount%3Fview%3Dazure-dotnet)
|**Windows - 10.0.1779.959<br>Ubuntu 18 - 10.0.1694.1<br>Ubuntu 20 - 10.0.1694.1** | **Feature** | ESE | **Brief Description**:The old ESE.dll version 15.0.805.2 is replaced with new version of ESE.dll 15.0.805.3.<br>**Feature**: This change will affect all customers using the SF runtime since the ESE.dll is used by all System services and by the KeyValueStore. 
|**Windows - 10.0.1779.959<br>Ubuntu 18 - 10.0.1694.1<br>Ubuntu 20 - 10.0.1694.1** | **Feature** | Security Audit | **Brief Description**: Service Fabric audites cluster management endpoints' security configurations. The following fields are audited: Action, ServiceName, Port, Protocol, X509StoreLocation, X509StoreName, X509FIndType, X509FindValue, CertificateInUseSHA1. The possible values of Action are "Start, Stop, Update, PeriodicCheck". The possible values of ServiceName are "HttpGateway, EntreeServiceProxy". User's endpoints will not be audited. <br>
|**Windows - 10.0.1779.959<br>Ubuntu 18 - 10.0.1694.1<br>Ubuntu 20 - 10.0.1694.1** | **Bug** | Diagnostics | **Brief Description**: The DEB package for Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04 has been updated to include "lttng-tools" as a dependency of Service Fabric, and the "lttng-modules-dkms" package has been removed as a dependency.<br>**Feature/Impact**: Due to the optional nature of the "lttng-tools" package in the "lttng-modules-dkms" dependency, there was a possibility that "lttng-tools" would not be installed with Service Fabric. This led to the malfunctioning of internal Service Fabric traces without "lttng-tools". <br> **Solution**:  To address this issue, the "lttng-tools" package has been added as a mandatory dependency to the Service Fabric package. <br>
|**Windows - 10.0.1779.959<br>Ubuntu 18 - 10.0.1694.1<br>Ubuntu 20 - 10.0.1694.1** | **Bug** | Reliable Collection | **Brief Description**: Enumeration operation in Reliable Collection(RC) occasionally throws ArgumentException, impacting all current managed RC users that use enumeration. The bug has been addressed by relaxing the constraint on the internal data structure to allow duplicated keys in non-steady state. If applicable, customers can implement a try-catch block to retry the Enumeration Operation with exponential backoff as a workaround. <br> **Solution**: The fix involves relaxing the constraint on the internal data structure to allow duplicated keys in non-steady state **Workaround**: Wrap the Enumeration Operation within a try-catch block to retry with exponential backoff.<br>
|**Windows - 10.0.1779.959<br>Ubuntu 18 - 10.0.1694.1<br>Ubuntu 20 - 10.0.1694.1** | **Feature** | Diagnostics | **Brief Description**: .<br>**Feature**: <br> **Solution**: <br> **Documentation Reference**: <br>

## Retirement and Deprecation Path Callouts
* As aligned with [Microsoft .NET and .NET Core - Microsoft Lifecycle | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core), SF Runtime has dropped support for Net Core 3.1 as of December 2022. For  supported versions see [Service Fabric supported Linux versions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-versions#current-versions-1) and migrate applications as needed.
* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS will reach its 5-year end-of-life window in June, 2023. Service Fabric runtime will drop support for 18.04 LTS after the published date, and we recommend moving your clusters and applications to supported versions listed here: [Service Fabric supported Linux versions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-versions#supported-linux-versions-and-support-end-date)
* Service Fabric runtime will soon stop supporting BinaryFormatter based remoting exception serialization by default and move to using Data Contract Serialization (DCS) based remoting exception serialization by default. Current applications using it will continue to work as-is, but Service Fabric strongly recommends moving to using Data Contract Serialization (DCS) based remoting exception instead.
* As called out in the previous releases, Service Fabric runtime will remove Service Fabric runtime version 6.4 packages and older, SDK version 3.3 packages and older from the package Download Center in July 2023. 
* Service Fabric runtime will soon be archiving and removing Service Fabric runtime versions less than 7.2 and older, as well as the corresponding SDK version 4.2 packages and older from the package Download Center. Archiving/Removing will affect application scaling and re-imaging of virtual machines in a Service Fabric Cluster running on unsupported versions. After older versions are removed/archived, this may cause failure while rolling back when the current in-progress upgrade has errors.<br>
To prevent disruption of workloads, create a new cluster using the following steps:<ul><li>[Create a Service Fabric cluster using ARM template](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/quickstart-cluster-template)</li><li>[Create a Standalone cluster](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-creation-for-windows-server)</li></ul> Install the supported version of Service Fabric SDK based on the Runtime version installed on the cluster.
